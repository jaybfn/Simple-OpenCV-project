# A smiple OpenCV project which demonstrates Face, Eye and Smile detection using Haar Classifier.

### Description:

Face detection with Haar cascades is a machine learning strategy that involves  a cascade function with a collection of input data. 
Many pre-trained classifiers for the face, eyes, smile and body , and other facial features are already included in OpenCV. 
We'll be utilizing some of the haar cascade classifier today to detect face, eye and smile on a webcam.

### Tech stack

1. Anaconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) or VS code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. python 3.9 
3. OpenCV (to install using pip, just type in the command terminal 'pip install opencv-python')

### Usage:

1. git clone this repo
2. Also, make sure you have installed OpenCV (more info: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
3. from your terminal run the .py file as 'python detection.py'
